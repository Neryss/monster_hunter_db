# monster_hunter_db
Database containing all monsters informations for MHW and MH: Rise

Both DB's have missing content, design wise or just missing, that's all. The main purpose was to use it as a Discord bot that I run locally, you can use it to display searched monster's stats (weaknesses, resistances, ailments, elements...).
Feel free to add things!

## MHW
This json was taken from the [MHW-db api](https://docs.mhw-db.com/), I've added missing content mostly from post Iceborne in the same format while not going through advanced stuff (Locations, rewards...).

Might be missing advanced informations such as locations, you can check the template for the first monster and add stats for the other ones if needed (or you can take a look at the api directly).

## MH: Rise
This one was made by scracth for, as previously stated, a Discord bot mainly. It contains less informations than the MHW one since I didn't need everything included from the lastest.

Also it doesn't contain the 1 star stats from most of the monsters, I've added this later thinking people might want these informations. That's basically what you can help the most on!

You can take a look at the [template](./rise_template.json) and add monsters such as small ones or ones added in the future if they are missing!
All the informations were taken directly from the [wiki](https://monsterhunterrise.wiki.fextralife.com/Monster+Hunter+Rise+Wiki) and belongs to Capcom. You can refer to it if you want to add missing data!

Also if you're looking to add missing stats for the first monsters, take a look at the last ones since they contain everything needed!

### Update about Rise
So now it's missing sunbreak content, that's all!
